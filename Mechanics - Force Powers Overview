Mechanics - Force Powers

As Each character has a deck of cards to choose from I would suggest they have each of the following (5 total according to faction)
The character could be dealt have 2 of them to choose from on any given turn.
When they run out the turns would skip straight to the 'fight' button and they can hack away at each other to the death.

We can of course amend this as we go!


The Mechanics envisage FORCE POWERS split into two categories - 
1) faction specific powers (which are only avaialbe to Dark Side or Light side characters depending on the power itself)
2) Skill modifiers (these modify a characters skills for that round)

FACTION SPECIFIC
(as you can see they all do pretty much the same thing - we can maybe add more nuance down the line!)

Jedi:

Force Push: inflicts random amount of damage on opponent
Force Heal: Heals the character for random number of health points

Sith:

Electicity Bolts: inflicts random amount of damage on opponent
Turn to the Dark Side:  Heals the character for random number of health points


SKILL MODIFIERS (feel free to think of better names than this!)

Force Strength:  Increases strength by 20% for one turn
Force Skill:  Increases Weapon Skill by 20% for one turn
Force Agility:  Increases Agility Skill by 20% for one turn
