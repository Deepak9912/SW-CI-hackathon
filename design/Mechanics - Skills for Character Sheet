GAME MECHANICS - SKILLS for CHARACTER SHEET:

The Strength, Weapon Skill and Agility Skill add up to a total of 75.  
Those points should be allocated to the character according to their percieved traits!
I'd suggest having a +-5 limit on each skill to begin with - we can alwasy amend as we balance the game

Miscellaneous:-

AFFILIATION:  Jedi or Sith (goodie or baddie I guess!)

Core Skills:-

STRENGTH: 20-30
WEAPON SKILL: 20-30
AGILITY: 20-30

NB total skill points should add up to 75

Each character should have the same base health - we can tweak it later or change the number if we need to balance the game.
HEALTH: 50

Each character will have a weapon pre-assigned depending on the character, which should probably also appear on the character sheet.

The weapons are as follows (as things stand):

Blue Light Sabre (for the Jedi) - +20% agility, -20% strength
Red Light Sabre (for the Sith) - +20% weapon skill, -20% agility
Double Ended Light Sabre (Darth Maul Only) - +20% strength, -20% agility
